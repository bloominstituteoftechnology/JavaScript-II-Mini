/* The for principles of "this";
* in your own words. explain the four principle for the "this" keyword below.
*
* 1. Window/Global Object Binding
    if 'this' is within a function that is being invoked, then that function's runtime environment i.e the window becomes it's context. Thus the window global object is what this points to. 
* 2. Principle 2: Implicit Binding
    'this' refers to the object within which 'this' may be used on a function of to set another property.
* 3. Principle 3: New binding
    Implies to the use of 'this' in a constructor context. 'this' refers to the object being passed out or created by the constructor. 
* 4. Principle 4: Explicit binding
    call or apply methods.
*
* write out a code example of each explanation above
